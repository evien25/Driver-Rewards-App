# Driver-Rewards-App
Full-stack app hosted entirely with AWS services, focussed on DevOps and containerization for quick and available setup.

This app utilized React, Python, Flask, Docker, MySQL, JSONIFY, HTML/CSS, shell scripting, and many more services/tools.

I was personally in charge of handling eBay and Amazon API functionality, retrieving real-time information from their RESTful API services for our app's catalog service.

The AWS services (RDS, EC2, VPC, IAMs, etc) were shut down after the semester was over due to Clemson's policies so the API's may not be responsive due to IP routing.


**SETUP AND RUNNING**

1) Download zip file, containing the project source code
2) Open zip via IDE (VS Code)
